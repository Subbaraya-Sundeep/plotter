Arduino Plotter
===============

A fun project I made with old dvd player drives. Computer
reads a bmp image and sends each pixel value and its coordinates
to Arduino via Serial port. Arduino moves the Pen assembly
to the received coordinates and moves down Pen if pixel value is
0 (bmp will have two pixel values only i.e., 0 for black 1 for white).
